            <p>[Verse 1]<br>
                Hold my hand, everything will be okay<br>
                I heard from the heavens that clouds have been grey<br>
                Pull me close, wrap me in your aching arms<br>
                I see that you're hurtin', why'd you take so long
            </p>

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleeding<br>
                You don't need to show me again<br>
                But if you decide to,<br>
                I'll ride in this life with you<br>
                I won't let go 'til the end
            </p>
            
            <p>[Chorus]<br>
                So cry tonight<br>
                But don't you let go of my hand <br>
                You can cry every last tear<br>
                I won't leave 'til I understand<br>
                Promise me, just hold my hand
            </p>

            <p>[Verse 2]<br> 
                Raise your head, look into my wishful eyes<br> 
                That fear that's inside you will lift, give it time<br>
                I can see everything you're blind to now<br>
                Your prayers will be answered, let God whisper how
            </p>

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleeding<br>
                You don't need to show me again<br>
                But if you decide to,<br>
                I'll ride in this life with you<br>
                I won't let go 'til the end
            </p>
            
            <p>[Chorus]<br>
                So cry tonight<br>
                But don't you let go of my hand <br>
                You can cry every last tear<br>
                I won't leave 'til I understand<br>
                Promise me, just hold my hand
            </p>

            <p>[Post-Chorus]<br> Hold my hand, hold my —<br> 
                Hold my hand, my hand<br>
                I'll be right here, hold my hand
            </p>

             <p>Hold my hand, hold my —<br>
                Hold my hand, my hand<br>
                I'll be right here, hold my hand
            </p>

            <p>[Bridge]<br> I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect<br>
                But don't you give up on yourself<br>
                I've heard a story, a girl, she once told me<br>
                That I would be happy again
            </p>
            
            <p>[Outro]<br> 
                Hold my hand<br>
                Hold my hand<br>
                Hold my hand, hold my hand<br>
                Hold my hand, hold my hand<br>
                Hold my hand<br>
                I heard from the heavens
            </p>
